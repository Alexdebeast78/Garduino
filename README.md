It will have features such as:  
  -Automatic Watering through the use of soil moisture sensors  
  -Automatic lighting for the plant through the use of photoresistors  
  -Float switch to signal when the water tank is empty  
  -It will be linked to a raspberry pi server so that all the data can be displayed on Node Red  
  -A dht sensor for more info
  
Hardware required  
  -Float switch  
  -2 panel relay switch  
  -Led strip  
  -Heltec wifi kit 32  
  -Dht11/22 sensor  
  -Photoresistors
