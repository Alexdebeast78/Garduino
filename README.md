# Garduino


## Description 
### Grow More With Less 
Garduino is an automatic garden made using Arduino that aims to demonstrate the benefits of sustainable farming.  
Garduino aims to solve several problems with traditional agriculture.  
Some of the hypothesised benefits of Garduino when implemented on a larger scale are that it will be able to:  
1. Improve yield of crops.
2. Optimize acreage.
3. Optimize the use of crop protection chemicals.
4. Optimize the use of energy.
5. Optimize the use of fertilizers.
6. Optimize water usage.
7. Reduce emissions within the farming process.
8. Reduce labour costs.
9. Reduce the impact of seasonality.
10. Remove the impact of weather.
